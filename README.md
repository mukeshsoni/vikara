## Support image types

- JPEG
- PNG
- AVIF
- HEIC
- Various Raw formats

TODO:

- [x] Make a logo
- [ ] Use rust to read images and convert to base64 so that we can show RAW images too
- [ ] After conversion is done, show the converted image besides the original image, in a pane. And add a button to save the converted image to some location.
- [ ] Add some button like "Convert another image" which will work similarly to the "Clear" button.
